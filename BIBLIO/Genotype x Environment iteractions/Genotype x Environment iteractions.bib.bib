This means that it will include not only the predictive components in {OPLS} but also the orthogonal components. Four variants of variable influence on projection ({VIP}) adapted to {OPLS} have been developed, tested and compared using three different data sets, one synthetic with known properties and two real-world cases.

	abstract = {Genotype by environment interaction ({GEI}) is one of the main challenges in plant breeding. A complete characterization of it is necessary to decide on proper breeding strategies. Random regression models ({RRMs}) allow a genotype-specific response to each regressor factor. {RRMs} that include selected environmental variables represent a promising approach to deal with {GEI} in genomic prediction. They enable to predict for both tested and untested environments, but their utility in a plant breeding scenario remains to be shown. We used phenotypic, climatic, pedigree, and genomic data from two public subtropical rice (Oryza sativa L.) breeding programs; one manages the indica population and the other manages the japonica population. First, we characterized {GEI} for grain yield ({GY}) with a set of tools: variance component estimation, mega-environment ({ME}) definition, and correlation between locations, sowing periods, and {MEs}. Then, we identified the most influential climatic variables related to {GY} and its {GEI} and used them in {RRMs} for single-step genomic prediction. Finally, we evaluated the predictive ability of these models for {GY} prediction in tested and untested years and environments using the complete dataset and within each {ME}. Our results suggest large {GEI} in both populations while larger in indica than in japonica. In indica, early sowing periods showed crossover (i.e., rank-change) {GEI} with other sowing periods. Climatic variables related to temperature, radiation, wind, and precipitation affecting {GY} were identified and differed in each population. {RRMs} with selected climatic covariates improved the predictive ability in both tested and untested years and environments. Prediction using the complete dataset performed better than predicting within each {ME}.},

	abstract = {Blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) has an important role in the global market, with consumption increasing steadily in the past decades. Adapted to multiple environments, a relevant question when investigating fruit quality attributes is the performance of different genotypes over multiple environmental conditions. In this study, we hypothesize that the use of environmental covariables ({ECs}) can improve the understanding of genotype-by-environment interaction and guide breeders’ decisions. To test it, we used twenty-four genotypes, evaluated across five harvest seasons (2018–2022) in four mega-environments in Florida (Citra {FL}, Central-North {FL}, Central {FL} and South {FL}), and investigated the impact of twenty-one environmental covariables on the phenotypic expression of five fruit quality traits (weight, total soluble solids, total titratable acidity, firmness, and size). Our contributions in this study are three: (I) first, we identified important temporal windows affecting the phenotypic plasticity for multiple traits; ({II}) using the environmental covariables, we draw attention on the importance of {ECs} that characterize the mega-environments and use such information in a mixed model framework to explain the genotype-by-environment interaction; and finally ({III}) we used linear regression (in the form of Finlay-Wilkinson regression) to estimate adaptability and stability metrics to select promising genotypes. Overall, these findings offer insights into the utility of environmental variables in explaining genotype stability and plasticity, thus, providing a framework to enhance predictive responses and optimize resource allocation in blueberry breeding.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Statistical laws on aggregates do not imply a normal distribution. Whenever the

a weather-conditioning index, then there is a disposition toward negative yield
skewness. This is because high marginal product in bad weather stretches out the
yield distribution's left tail relative to that for weather. For disaggregated yields,
unconditional skewness is decomposed into weather-conditioned skewness plus two
other terms and each is studied in turn.},

	abstract = {Nearest neighbor methods have become popular in official statistics, mainly in imputation or in statistical matching problems; they play a key role in machine learning too, where a high number of variants have been proposed. The choice of the distance function depends mainly on the type of the selected variables. Unfortunately, relatively few options permit to handle mixed type variables, a situation frequently encountered in official statistics. The most popular distance for mixed type variables is derived as the complement of the Gower's similarity coefficient; it is appealing because ranges between 0 and 1 and allows to handle missing values. Unfortunately, the unweighted standard setting the contribution of the single variables to the overall Gower's distance is unbalanced because of the different nature of the variables themselves. This article tries to address the main drawbacks that affect the overall unweighted Gower's distance by suggesting some modifications in calculating the distance on the interval and ratio scaled variables. Simple modifications try to attenuate the impact of outliers on the scaled Manhattan distance; other modifications, relying on the kernel density estimation methods attempt to reduce the unbalanced contribution of the different types of variables. The performance of the proposals is evaluated in simulations mimicking the imputation of missing values through nearest neighbor distance hotdeck method.},

	abstract = {Maize is recognized as one of the four major crops in the world and plays an important role in global agri-food systems. Therefore, understanding how maize yield responds to climate change is essential for addressing the challenges of exponential population growth and food security. In this study, maize yield data in 77 countries from 1982 to 2016 and seven essential climate variables ({ECVs}) were collected to assess the effects of climate change on maize yield variation. To this end, potential {ECVs} were first divided into three groups: energy availability (net surface solar radiation, air temperature and land surface temperature), water availability (soil moisture and precipitation), and exchange efficiency (relative humidity and wind speed), which are closely related to crop growth. Correlation analysis was conducted to determine the best {ECVs} for further investigation. Furthermore, the generalized additive model ({GAM}) was used to express yield as function to the {ECVs} in each country. Specifically, the first-order difference in maize yield and {ECVs} were considered in data process to maximize the effects of reductions from other factors such as crop management and cultivars. Finally, the performance of the proposed approach was compared with that of widely used multiple regression method. The results indicate that: (1) a global average of 46\% of maize yield variability can be explained by {ECVs} variability, yet significant discrepancies exist for different countries; (2) over 73\% of countries are dominated by more than two groups of {ECVs}; (3) {GAM} generally outperforms the traditional multiple regression method in more than 80\% of the investigated countries. This study offers a fresh perspective for investigating maize yield responses to climate change.},

However environments are created, the analysis of such trials may well disclose the presence of genotype—environment interactions. As Comstock and Moll (1963) wrote},

	abstract = {Wheat, rice, maize, and soybean provide two-thirds of human caloric intake. Assessing the impact of global temperature increase on production of these crops is therefore critical to maintaining global food supply, but different studies have yielded different results. Here, we investigated the impacts of temperature on yields of the four crops by compiling extensive published results from four analytical methods: global grid-based and local point-based models, statistical regressions, and field-warming experiments. Results from the different methods consistently showed negative temperature impacts on crop yield at the global scale, generally underpinned by similar impacts at country and site scales. Without {CO}2 fertilization, effective adaptation, and genetic improvement, each degree-Celsius increase in global mean temperature would, on average, reduce global yields of wheat by 6.0\%, rice by 3.2\%, maize by 7.4\%, and soybean by 3.1\%. Results are highly heterogeneous across crops and geographical areas, with some positive impact estimates. Multimethod analyses improved the confidence in assessments of future climate impacts on global major crops and suggest crop- and region-specific adaptation strategies to ensure food security for an increasing world population.},

	abstract = {The phenotype of an individual is determined by both the genotype and environment. Farmers and scientists aim to determine a superior genotype over a wide range of environmental conditions but also over years. The basic cause of differences between genotypes in their yield stability is when these two effects are not only additive, i.e. when genotype × environment interaction ({GEI}) is present in the data. Multi-location trials play an important role in plant breeding and agronomic research. The data from such trials have three main points: (i) to accurately estimate and predict yield based on limited experimental data; (ii) to determine yield stability and the pattern of response of genotypes across environments; and (iii) to provide reliable guidance for selecting the best genotypes or agronomic treatments for planting in future years and at new sites (Crossa, 1990). The purpose of the present paper is (i) to describe various multivariate statistical methods for analyzing interactions in general and {GEI} in particular, and (ii) to present a selected bibliography of 142 references to previous work.},

	abstract = {Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity is crucial for predicting and managing climate change effects on wild plants and crops. Here, we combined crop modeling and quantitative genetics to study the genetic control of oil yield plasticity for multiple abiotic stresses in sunflower. First we developed stress indicators to characterize 14 environments for three abiotic stresses (cold, drought and nitrogen) using the {SUNFLO} crop model and phenotypic variations of three commercial varieties. The computed plant stress indicators better explain yield variation than descriptors at the climatic or crop levels. In those environments, we observed oil yield of 317 sunflower hybrids and regressed it with three selected stress indicators. The slopes of cold stress norm reaction were used as plasticity phenotypes in the following genome-wide association study. Among the 65,534 tested {SNP}, we identified nine {QTL} controlling oil yield plasticity to cold stress. Associated {SNP} are localized in genes previously shown to be involved in cold stress responses: oligopeptide transporters, {LTP}, cystatin, alternative oxidase, or root development. This novel approach opens new perspectives to identify genomic regions involved in genotype-by-environment interaction of a complex traits to multiple stresses in realistic natural or agronomical conditions.},
